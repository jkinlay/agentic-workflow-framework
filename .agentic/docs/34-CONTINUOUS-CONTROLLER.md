# Continuous controller contract

Version 1.9.3. While scoped work remains, the controller continues every configured stream until completion, an owner stop, or a recorded stream-specific blocker. `ContinuousControllerStore` persists decisions and grants no host, provider, Jira, or merge authority.

## Production entry point

Run production operations only through the workflow entry point:

```text
python .agentic/scripts/workflow.py controller --state ABSOLUTE_PROTECTED_DB --stream A --stream B --stream C --worktree-root ABSOLUTE_WORKTREE --project-config PROJECT_CONFIG --adapter-module REVIEWED_ADAPTER.py --adapter-sha256 PIN --adapter-config ADAPTER_CONFIG cycle --inventory-binding INVENTORY_BINDING --repository-root ABSOLUTE_REPOSITORY --repository-head-sha FULL_HEAD --repository-tree-sha FULL_TREE --now TIME --host-capacity N
```

`cycle` calls `production_controller_cycle`: observe authenticated inventory, schedule, persist dispatch intent, invoke dispatch or uncertain-operation observation, deliver the cadence digest, and acknowledge only exact delivery readback. The adapter is loaded from the exact UTF-8 bytes matching its SHA-256 pin. It must be an absolute regular single-link file of at most 1 MiB exposing `build_adapters(config)`. No shell string or unpinned executable is accepted. Missing operations fail closed.

`jira-lifecycle` uses the same pinned adapter for read-before-write, at most one mapped write, and independent readback. `merge-observed` validates the merge before reconciliation and a fresh scoped Jira count. `snapshot` is read-only.

Protected state must be absolute and outside every declared worktree. The state factory rejects links, reparse points and hardlink aliases, applies owner-only permissions, and checks SQLite integrity, application identity and schema version on every open.

## No silent idle state

Each stream is `WORKING`, `PAUSED_INPUT`, `BLOCKED`, or `COMPLETE`. Every row names its ticket, actor, reason, next action, resume trigger, exact tuple, activity, verification gate, reviewer counts, findings and Jira observation. `COMPLETE` means the current scoped backlog has no remaining action.

Selection is deterministic by priority and ticket identity. It preserves one writer per overlapping path and checks dependencies, budgets, run and amendment caps, reviewer independence and observed host capacity. The production cycle pins one absolute worktree and exact Git head/tree. Git index spelling supplies the canonical path inventory. Case aliases collapse to that spelling; case collisions, paths without a canonical parent, Git symlinks, nested repositories, filesystem symlinks, junctions, reparse points and hardlinked files fail closed. The protected ledger refuses a later repository/worktree binding change. A blocked stream never pauses eligible work elsewhere.

Reviewer counts are admitted only when `required = completed + outstanding` and `completed = acceptable + failed + stale`. Contradictory inventory fails before scheduling, dispatch or status delivery. Running work is revalidated on every inventory observation. A completed ticket must be absent or terminal before refill.

## Dispatch and cadence

Dispatch intent is durable before the host call. An interrupted call becomes `UNKNOWN` and is reconciled only by observation; it is never blindly replayed. Unrelated streams continue after one adapter failure.

The default digest cadence is 900 seconds; configured cadence must be positive. A change can produce an immediate `CHANGE` digest without resetting the next regular deadline. The acknowledged outbox replays one `delivery_id` until exact delivery readback succeeds. Restarts preserve pending delivery, and clock rollback fails closed. Every digest covers all streams and their exact gate state.

## Jira lifecycle and merge progress

Jira disabled means no read or write. Otherwise lifecycle production first recovers in-flight operations as `UNKNOWN`, reads the bound issue and reconciles every unknown durable intent before planning. Operation and record UUIDs derive deterministically from the immutable intent. The protected ledger persists the intent as `PENDING`, commits `IN_FLIGHT` before provider mutation, and preserves the same operation ID over restart. A lost response is never reissued: a current target-state readback completes it, while any unproven result remains `UNKNOWN` and stops writes for that ticket. No caller supplies prior-write history. A new write requires an exact operation/issue receipt and later bound readback; mismatch or timestamp reversal fails closed while other streams continue.

After a validated merge, reconcile the merged ticket first. Only then page through the complete configured scope. Every page must share the scope digest, snapshot ID and observation time, and that observation must be at or after reconciliation. Counts use stable ticket IDs and terminal categories, exclude Epics unless requested, and enforce page, item, byte, time and cursor bounds. Any missing, stale, duplicate, partial or mismatched evidence reports both counts as `UNOBSERVED`.

Final review submission separately requires the [review completion barrier](33-REVIEW-COMPLETION-BARRIER.md).
